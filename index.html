         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>I am 23 years old, very outgoing and enjoy the outdoors. I take pride in My hard work.
         I recently took up web development as its always fascinated me, little did i know
         i'd fall in love with it so quickly. I find enjoyment in overcoming challenges
         and learning new things. The Poem "law of the jungle" has always held
         a significant place for me, as the meaning is broad and deep. My interpreptation
         of this would come from the line "for the strength of the pack is the wolf,
         and the strength of the wolf is the pack" as a pack (team or family),
         we're always stronger together.
